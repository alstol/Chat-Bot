# Chat-Bot

## Purpose

This repository holds some kind of funky idea I made during a hackathon organised by LEGO Group. The purpose behind it was to create some kind of chat-bot to assist with one of the internal processes. Since I liked the idea so much, I have decided to publish it here.

## Scenarios

The bot has a bunch of scenarios. Each scenario has a sentence or a list of keywords. Whenever you write a message, it compares the message with all the possible scenarios/keywords, then it creates a ranking system. Whatever scenario will rank highest, it will be the one that it's going to be executed.
I'm aware it's not a big deal and you can just say random words and it will execute a scenario, but I'm really proud I managed to come up with this in such a short amount of time :)

## TTS

After publishing the chatbot, I figured it would be a funky idea to add TTS. I'm using the HTML5 TTS plugin (which can be disabled via checkbox).
